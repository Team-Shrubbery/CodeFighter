## Overview

CodeFighter is a "best 2-out-of-3" style fighting game where opponents will battle in a 3-round fight. Our vision is to create an entertaining multiplayer experience to allow users to battle online. It solves the pain point of ever-present boredom, and what better way than to play a game with someone else! Our product provides an opportunity for social interaction in a socially-distant world.
